# Income inequality and health research

I wrote my Master's thesis on the topic of income inequality and health in Canadian cities. To show inequality throughout Canada, I mapped inequality levels for each Canadian city for three time periods: 2001, 2006, and 2011.

Here is a reproduction of that map, which now includes 2016.

# Map

# load libraries
```{r setup, include=FALSE}

library(leaflet)
library(maps)

# Here I set up the Canada map from the map package
mapStates = map(regions=sov.expand("Canada"), fill = TRUE, plot = FALSE) 

# add data
  #here I add the boundary files from Statistics Canada
#bound <- read.gml(file, as = c("srt", "array"), directed = TRUE, coords = FALSE)

# this works, and makes a canada map - it's purple
leaflet(data = mapStates) %>% 
  addTiles() %>%
  addPolygons(color = "#bdd7e7", stroke = FALSE) %>%
  





```
