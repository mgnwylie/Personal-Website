<p>Hello again, long time no write/read. Also, long time no R programming for me…</p>
<p>Despite my lack of R practice over the previous few months, a recent project emerged that was both familiar and motivating.</p>
<p>My brother runs his own commercial and personal electrical business. He is a skilled electritian with a strong network of tradesman, making it relatively easy for him to find work. But when it comes to reaching beyond who he knows, he is often lacking some of the things I learned back in the day in business school. Marketing.</p>
<p>I thought it would be a great idea to make him a business website for his birthday! Websites explain what the business is, who works for it, and what it can offer. Even thought the business is mostly just him at the moment, I wanted to create a place where he could share more about himself and his successful work.</p>
<p>It also provides a place for new or known people to find him online.</p>
<p>I had made my website nearly a year ago and thought it would be fun to strengthen one thing I know a little bit about… making R blogdown websites.</p>
<p>For this website I dug more into the CSS and purchased a domain! Here is what I learned.</p>
<div id="dont-download-copy-and-paste-a-theme-into-your-working-directory" class="section level1">
<h1>Don’t download, copy, and paste a theme into your working directory</h1>
<p>I downloaded the theme template off of GitHub and simply copy and pasted it into my working directory on my computer. This worked fine at first, but I wasn’t able to deploy the website via Netlify due to some configuration issues.</p>
<p>The issue was that Netlify couldn’t find the template, which requires a ___ file. This file is autogenerated when you pull the template repository from Git using Blogdown, but needs to be handwritten if you copy and paste the folder.</p>
<p>You can pull the template by doing the following…</p>
<p>{```}
blogdown::new_site(theme = ‘lxndrblz/anatole’)</p>
<p>’’’</p>
</div>
<div id="you-can-edit-the-website-in-the-template-folder" class="section level1">
<h1>You can edit the website in the template folder</h1>
<p>I wanted to change the color and some design features of the website. Not extreme changes, I don’t know CSS, but some minor edits: removing sections of the site, changing pictures, and creating links to my brother’s email.</p>
<p>All of this was done in the <em>template</em> folder.</p>
<p>I choose a simple theme with simple elements to ensure that I could make these basic changes. (Most of my editing just came from searching for words or color codes associated with what I wanted to change on the website)! For more complex themes this will be a bigger issue… I’ll record anything I learn for that time and place.</p>
</div>
<div id="yay-i-did-it" class="section level1">
<h1>Yay, I did it!</h1>
<p>So happy birthday to my brother - 31 and a successful business man with his own new domain: <a href="www.jwelectric.ca">jwelectric.ca</a>. Please go take a look and let me know what you think. (ᵔᴥᵔ)</p>
<p>The site is deployed and functioning excellent: my first domain, first customer? Nah, not yet. Maybe when his business grows and he needs me to do more with the website functionalities.</p>
<p>This website builds upon the <a href="https://github.com/cowboysmall-tools/hugo-business-frontpage-theme">Hugo Business Frontpage theme</a> by <a href="https://github.com/cowboysmall-tools">Cowboysmall</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks and stay safe everyone! ❤️
