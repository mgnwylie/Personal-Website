title: Inequality in Canada: Interactive Map
---

# Income inequality and health research

I wrote my Master's thesis on the topic of income inequality and health in Canadian cities. To show inequality throughout Canada, I mapped inequality levels for each Canadian city for three time periods: 2001, 2006, and 2011.

Here is a reproduction of that map, which now includes 2016.

# Map

# load libraries
```{r}

library(leaflet)

m <- leaflet(options = leafletOptions(minZoom = 0, maxZoom = 25)) %>%
  addTiles() %>%  # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles
  setView(56.1304, -106.3468, zoom = 18)

m

# add data


```
