# Income inequality and health research

I wrote my Master's thesis on the topic of income inequality and health in Canadian cities. To show inequality throughout Canada, I mapped inequality levels for each Canadian city for three time periods: 2001, 2006, and 2011.

Here is a reproduction of that map, which now includes 2016.
