	        <p>Hello again! New year, and I'm already getting into more complicated hugo/blogdown projects.</p>
<p>Over the holidays I'd been blogging and encountered some (unfixable to me) issues with the first site I generated. After consultation with colleagues and many many hours on SO and various other websites, I decided to start over.</p>
<p>Upon reading through the <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/other-themes.html">blogdown book</a> again, I decided to try one of their simple recommended themes! I went with <a href="https://github.com/AlexFinn/simple-a">simple-a</a> because it looked nice and was recommended by the blogdown folks.</p>
<p>It doesn't have much documentation, so here is how I changed some of the simple aspects of the blog.</p>
<h1 id="header-and-footer-names">Header and footer names</h1>
<p>The site has <em>Alex Finn</em> written all over it (thanks for making the theme!). I immediatly wanted to make sure that I could personalize the content and make the site cohestively mine.</p>
<p>All of the website HTML documents are in the theme folder.</p>
<p>~themes\simple-a\layouts\partials</p>
<h1 id="what-to-change">What to change</h1>
<p>There were a few key areas I wanted to update:</p>
<ul>
<li>the website name in the tab</li>
<li>the images</li>
<li>the copyright and year</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="website-name">Website name</h2>
<p>To do this, I had to change the data in the metadata html. This also allowed me to change the website author metadata.</p>
<h2 id="images">Images</h2>
<p>The image above the blog posts can be changed in the menu.html file. I was able to change the image to my profile picture, however, it will require some format changes in the future.</p>
<h2 id="copyright-and-year">Copyright and year</h2>
<p>I'm not sure if I'm supposed to change this! Simple-a is not my theme, but all of the content is mine.</p>
<p>Note to self, add a theme link!</p>
<p>The file to change the copyright and year information is the footer.html. To be safe I added a sentence that references the simple-a theme I'm basing my website on.</p>
<p>I'll continue to add more notes as I go along. :)</p>
