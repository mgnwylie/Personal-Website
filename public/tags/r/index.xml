      <description>This week for R Ladies we did a tutorial on stock market analysis. Led by Scott Clone, the group downloaded data on stock market prices from the internet, reformatted the data, and created a portfolio of the stocks based on risk preferences.
All code here was written by Scott Clone, and I just outline my own learnings from the tutorial.
DocumentsAs usual, all of the documents can be found on the RLadies GitHub page.</description>
