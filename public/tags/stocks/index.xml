      <description>This week for R Ladies we did stock market analysis! Led by Scott Clone, the group downloaded data on stock market prices from the internet, reformatted the data, and created portfolios of the stocks based on risk preferences. We were risky investors!
All code here was written by Scott Clone, and I outline in my notes what I learned from the tutorial.
Documents As usual, all of the documents can be found on the RLadies GitHub page.</description>
