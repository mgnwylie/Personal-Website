      <description>Hello again! New year, and I&#39;m already getting into more complicated hugo/blogdown projects.
Over the holidays I&#39;d been blogging and encountered some (unfixable to me) issues with the first site I generated. After consultation with colleagues and many many hours on SO and various other websites, I decided to start over.
Upon reading through the blogdown book again, I decided to try one of their simple recommended themes! I went with simple-a because it looked nice and was recommended by the blogdown folks.</description>
