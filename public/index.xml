      <description>Income inequality and health researchI wrote my Master’s thesis on the topic of income inequality and health in Canadian cities. To show inequality throughout Canada, I mapped inequality levels for each Canadian city for three time periods: 2001, 2006, and 2011.
Here is a reproduction of that map, which now includes 2016.

      <description>Last month, on a break during my workday, I decided to google some communities where I could practice and learn to code in R. It had been on my mind for a while, as I’ve had many side project ideas and lack any coding skills to make them happen.
~R Ladies~I came across R Ladies - a community of women (and other folks) in Montreal that meet once a month to learn something new in R!</description>

      <description>I created a new website using Hugo! This will be a slow process to figure out, but I&#39;m hoping to make it my long-term, sustained website where I can blog about learning code and share figures and stories related to my research.
See ya soon, Megan</description>

      <title>A Plain Markdown Post</title>

      <description>This is a post written in plain Markdown (*.md) instead of R Markdown (*.Rmd). The major differences are:
 You cannot run any R code in a plain Markdown document, whereas in an R Markdown document, you can embed R code chunks (```{r}); A plain Markdown post is rendered through Blackfriday, and an R Markdown document is compiled by rmarkdown and Pandoc.  There are many differences in syntax between Blackfriday&#39;s Markdown and Pandoc&#39;s Markdown.</description>

      <description>R MarkdownThis is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com.
You can embed an R code chunk like this:
